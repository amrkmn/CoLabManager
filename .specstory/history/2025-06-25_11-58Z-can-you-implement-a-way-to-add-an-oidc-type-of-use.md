Can you implement a way to add an OIDC type of user login?

---

_**Assistant**_

To implement OIDC (OpenID Connect) user login, you'll need to:

1. Integrate an OIDC client library (e.g., `@auth/core` with SvelteKit, or `openid-client`).
2. Add configuration for your OIDC provider (client ID, secret, issuer, etc.).
3. Create login and callback endpoints to handle the OIDC flow.
4. Store the authenticated user in your session/local state.

Here’s a high-level plan for your SvelteKit app:

- Install an OIDC library.
- Add OIDC config (e.g., in `.env` or a config file).
- Create `/auth/oidc/login` endpoint to redirect to the OIDC provider.
- Create `/auth/oidc/callback` endpoint to handle the provider’s response, validate the ID token, and create a session.
- Update your session management to support OIDC users.

Would you like to use a specific OIDC provider (e.g., Google, Auth0, Azure AD), or should I show a generic example? And do you want to use a library like `@auth/core` (formerly NextAuth.js, now framework-agnostic), or a lower-level library like `openid-client`?

instead of `openid-client`, use `arctic`

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! To implement OIDC login using the `arctic` library in your SvelteKit app, you’ll need to:

1. Install `arctic` and its peer dependencies.
2. Add OIDC provider configuration to your `.env` file.
3. Create endpoints for login and callback using `arctic` in your SvelteKit routes.
4. Update your session logic to handle OIDC users.

Let’s start by installing the required packages.

I'll run the installation for `arctic` and its peer dependencies.

`@lucia-auth/sveltekit @lucia-auth/adapter-prisma` not needed

---

_**Assistant**_

Understood! I’ll proceed with a minimal OIDC login using only the `arctic` library (no Lucia or adapter packages), and I’ll use Bun for package management.

Here’s what I’ll do next:
1. Add OIDC provider config to your `.env`.
2. Install `arctic` using Bun.
3. Scaffold SvelteKit endpoints for `/auth/oidc/login` and `/auth/oidc/callback` using `arctic`.
4. Show you how to handle the session for OIDC users.

Let’s start by installing `arctic` with Bun. `arctic` is now installed. Next, you need to add OIDC provider configuration to your `.env` file. Here’s a template for a generic OIDC provider (e.g., Auth0, Google, etc.):

```dotenv
OIDC_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
OID_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
OIDC_ISSUER="https://your-oidc-provider.com"
OIDC_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:5173/auth/oidc/callback"
```

Would you like me to add these lines to your `.env` file, or do you want to specify your actual OIDC provider details first?

Now make the api

---

_**Assistant**_

You already have the OIDC config in your `.env`. Next, I’ll scaffold the SvelteKit API endpoints for OIDC login using `arctic`:

- `/src/routes/auth/oidc/login/+server.ts`: Redirects to the OIDC provider.
- `/src/routes/auth/oidc/callback/+server.ts`: Handles the OIDC callback, verifies the token, and sets a session.

I’ll create these files now.

Your OIDC login API is now scaffolded using `arctic`:

- `/auth/oidc/login` redirects users to your OIDC provider.
- `/auth/oidc/callback` handles the OIDC response, decodes the ID token, and returns the claims (for now).

You can now:
- Link users to `/auth/oidc/login` to start the login flow.
- Handle the returned claims in `/auth/oidc/callback` to create/find users and set up sessions.

Would you like to see how to persist the session or connect this to your user database?

Now add to the login page

_**Assistant**_

A "Continue with OIDC" button has been added to your login page. Users can now click this button to start the OIDC login flow via `/auth/oidc/login`.

You can further style or position the button as needed. If you want to handle the returned user session or claims, let me know and I can help you wire that up!

Got bad request trying to 

---

_**Assistant**_

The error is likely because your OIDC provider expects the callback URL to match exactly what is registered in their dashboard. Your `.env` and code use:

- `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:5173/auth/oidc/callback"`

But your error message shows:

- `"callbackURL":"http://localhost:5173/api/auth/oidc/callback"`

This mismatch will cause a "bad request" or "redirect_uri_mismatch" error from the OIDC provider.

**How to fix:**
- Make sure your OIDC provider's dashboard has the redirect URI set to `http://localhost:5173/auth/oidc/callback`.
- In your code and `.env`, always use `/auth/oidc/callback` (not `/api/auth/oidc/callback`).

If you want to use `/api/auth/oidc/callback`, update both your `.env` and your OIDC provider dashboard to match.

Would you like me to check and update your `.env` and code to ensure the redirect URI is consistent?

`OIDC callback error`

I've added error logging to the OIDC callback handler. Now, when an error occurs, the details will be printed to your server logs. 

Please try the OIDC login flow again and check your server logs for the specific error message. Share the log output here, and I can help you debug the exact cause of the callback error.

OIDC callback error: 165 |     }
166 | }
167 | export class UnexpectedResponseError extends Error {
168 |     status;
169 |     constructor(responseStatus) {
170 |         super("Unexpected error response");
              ^
error: Unexpected error response
 status: 200,

      at new UnexpectedResponseError (C:\Amar\Codes\CoLabManager\node_modules\arctic\dist\request.js:170:9)

---

_**Assistant**_

The error `UnexpectedResponseError` with `status: 200` from Arctic means the OIDC provider returned a 200 OK response, but the response body was not what Arctic expected (likely not a valid OAuth2 token response).

**Common causes:**
- The `Content-Type` of the token response is not `application/json`.
- The token endpoint is returning HTML or a different format (e.g., due to a misconfiguration or missing parameter).
- The request to the token endpoint is missing required parameters.

**How to debug/fix:**

1. **Check the token endpoint URL:**  
   Make sure you are using the correct token endpoint. Your code:
   ```ts
   new URL(`/token`, `${env.OIDC_ISSUER}`).toString()
   ```
   This is correct if your issuer is like `https://id.ujol.dev/` and the token endpoint is `https://id.ujol.dev/token`.

2. **Check OIDC provider logs:**  
   See if the provider logs show a reason for a bad/malformed request.

3. **Log the response body:**  
   To debug, you can temporarily patch Arctic or intercept the fetch to log the response body from the token endpoint.

4. **Check required parameters:**  
   Make sure your OIDC client is registered for the correct redirect URI and is using the correct client secret, client ID, and scopes.

5. **Check for PKCE:**  
   If your provider requires PKCE, you must use `createAuthorizationURLWithPKCE` and provide a code verifier/challenge.

---

**Next step:**  
Would you like me to update your login flow to use PKCE (which is required by some OIDC providers), or help you log the token endpoint response for further debugging? If you know your provider requires PKCE, I can update your code for that.

OIDC callback error: 43 |             return this.data.scope.split(" ");
44 |         }
45 |         throw new Error("Missing or invalid 'scope' field");
46 |     }
47 |     idToken() {
48 |         if ("id_token" in this.data && typeof this.data.id_token === "string") {

TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.data')
      at idToken (C:\Amar\Codes\CoLabManager\node_modules\arctic\dist\oauth2.js:48:27)

---

_**Assistant**_

The error `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.data')` in Arctic's `idToken()` means the token response from your OIDC provider is not in the expected format—likely because the token endpoint URL is incorrect.

You are using:
```ts
new URL(`/api/oidc/token`, `${env.OIDC_ISSUER}`).toString()
```
This results in a token endpoint like:
```
https://id.ujol.dev/api/oidc/token
```
But for most OIDC providers, the token endpoint is:
```
https://id.ujol.dev/token
```
**Remove `/api/oidc/` from the token endpoint path.**

---

### How to fix

Update your callback code to:
```ts
const tokens = await oidc.validateAuthorizationCode(
    new URL(`/token`, `${env.OIDC_ISSUER}`).toString(),
    code,
    null
);
```
Do this in both your login and callback logic if needed.

Would you like me to make this change for you?

```

````

````
Your code is correct to use `/api/oidc/token` as the token endpoint, since your provider's OpenID configuration specifies:

```
"token_endpoint":"https://id.ujol.dev/api/oidc/token"
```

If you are still getting errors, the issue is likely with the request parameters or the provider's response format. If the error persists, please enable more detailed logging of the response from the token endpoint, or share the full error output (including any response body if possible). This will help pinpoint the root cause. 

Would you like help adding code to log the full response from the token endpoint for further debugging?

I've added logging for the full OIDC token response. Please try the OIDC login flow again and check your server logs for the output of `OIDC token response:`. 

Share the log output here if you need further help interpreting or debugging the response. This will help us determine if the response is missing fields or is in an unexpected format.
